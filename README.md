# my-osep-learnings

 this complete repo has all information realated to osep preparation .


**before lab learnings or prerquisits --> **

learn c#  - its importent to have understanding about this language inorder to build the exploits and scripts . This will not only help you in clearning your certification but also it will help in red teaming engagements . I dont know why people says coding is not requried , to be honest its required as an red teamer or for long term survival. A lot of defensive solutions are blocking the common techniques so its better to learn some code and design your own custom code to evade the detections . 

resources - if you are aboslute beginner then i recommand Mosh Hamedani courses . this guy is amazing :)
