# my-osep-learnings

i started my lab  - on 1st august 2021 . this complete repo has all information realated to osep preparation


prerquisits --> 

learn c#  - its very much importent have understanding about this language inorder to build the exploits and scripts . This will not only help in you in clearning your certification but also it will help in red teamings . I dont know why people  says coding is not requried , to be honest its required as an red teamer . A lot of defensive solutions are blocking the common techniques so its better to learn some code and design your own custom code to evade the detections . 

resources - if you are aboslute beginner then i recommand Mosh Hamedani courses . this guy is amazing :)
